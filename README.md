SECUFLOW MINER Project Summary
Project Overview
SECUFLOW MINER is a collaborative security analysis tool designed to help security analysts visualize and quantify data while coordinating collaboration between development and security teams. The core goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of potential security risks caused by poor team collaboration. Core Functionality

MC-STC Calculation: Calculates and analyzes the time complexity of multi-dimensional collaborative security.
Data Visualization: Provides professional visualizations such as CR and CA matrices.
Collaboration Pattern Monitoring: Tracks and evaluates changes in team collaboration patterns over time.
Real-Time Security Feedback: Provides immediate security insights through a pull request review system.

Technical Architecture
Front-End

Framework: React
Functionality: Interactive user interface and data visualization components.
Visualization Libraries: Chart.js, D3.js, etc.
Coding Standards: Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.

Back-End

Language: Python
Framework: Django + Django REST Framework
Responsibilities: MC-STC calculation, data processing, API management.
Data Storage: CSV files (simplifies complexity).
Coding Standards: PEP 8 guidelines.

Architectural Patterns

Client-Server Model: Clearly separates data processing and user interaction.
RESTful API: Provides scalability and flexibility.
Front-End and Back-End Separation: Facilitates independent development and maintenance.

User Role Evolution

Project Manager: Monitors progress and evaluates collaboration.
Programmer: Writes and optimizes Python code.
Security Analyst: Shifting from traditional monitoring to collaborative analysis
Developers: Integrating security considerations throughout the development lifecycle
Security Engineers: Shifting from independent reviewers to active participants in the development lifecycle

Development Methodology
Agile Development (Adapted Scrum)

Iteration Cycle: 5 Sprints, each approximately 2 weeks
Meeting Frequency: At least 2 online meetings per week
Featured Practices:

Scrum Master Rotation System
Phase-based Development Strategy (Front-end, Back-end)
Flexible Customer Feedback Mechanism

Development Strategy

Phase 1: Focusing on back-end data processing and calculation accuracy
Phase 2: Integrating front-end visualization and user interface optimization
Continuous Optimization: Continuously iterating and improving based on customer feedback

Key Achievements
Technology Integration

Evolving from basic tools to an advanced analytics framework
Integrating MC-STC metrics and visualization tools
Implementing a structured PR review process

Collaborative Improvement

Introducing quantitative collaboration metrics
Shifting from isolated roles to integrated workflows
Establishing a cross-team validation mechanism

Quality Assurance

Verifying back-end calculation accuracy
Automated testing (unittest/pytest)
Code review process (GitHub PRs)

Customer feedback integration

Regularly passing Maintain communication via Slack.
Submit UI screenshots for client review.
Adjust visualization requirements based on feedback.
Simplify data storage solution (CSV instead of MySQL).

Project Experience and Lessons Learned
Success Strategies

Phase-based development: Ensure backend accuracy first, then optimize front-end presentation.
Flexible adjustments: Agile methodologies allow for rapid iteration based on client feedback.
Clear division of labor: Separating front-end and back-end development improves development efficiency.
Continuous communication: Regular feedback mechanisms avoid rework later.

Improvement Directions

Prepare a detailed list of requirements issues at the beginning of the project.
Consistently confirm with the client the rationality and necessity of the requirements.
Keep development tasks closely aligned with Sprint planning.
Balance flexibility and a structured approach.

Project Impact
This project not only improved security effectiveness but also significantly boosted team efficiency, ultimately exceeding initial expectations. By quantifying collaboration patterns and providing real-time security insights, SECUFLOW MINER provides security analysts with a powerful tool to identify and address security vulnerabilities caused by poor collaboration.
